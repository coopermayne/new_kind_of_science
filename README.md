#New Kind of Science

a ruby program that generates images based on simple rules... surprisingly complex results.

i start with an empty grid with 1 black cell positioned top middle. then i generate the next line by applying 8 simple rules that look at the 3 cells about each pixel to determine that cells color... this process is inspired by the book New Kind of Science
